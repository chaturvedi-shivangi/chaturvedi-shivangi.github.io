## About
I am a Research Associate at the Indian School of Business (ISB), working under Professors Aprajit Mahajan (UC Berkeley), Prabhat Barnwal (Michigan State University) and Aaditya Dar (Amazon) in development economics and governance. I am currently working on improving state capacity and bureacratic efficiency in Punjab. My research interests lie in working at the intersection of development economics and public policy. Prior to joining ISB, I worked at Pratham Education Foundation on implementing education interventions aimed at improving foundational learning outcomes. 

I aim to leverage my academic background in Economics to contribute meaningfully to designing effective policies to address pressing development issues.
