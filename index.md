## About
I am a Research Associate at the [Indian School of Business (ISB)](https://www.isb.edu/en.html), working with Professors [Aprajit Mahajan](https://are.berkeley.edu/~aprajit/) (UC Berkeley), [Prabhat Barnwal](https://espp.msu.edu/directory/barnwal-prabhat.html) (Michigan State University) and [Aaditya Dar](https://aadityadar.com/) (Amazon). My current work focuses on improving state capacity and bureacratic effectiveness in Punjab. My research interests lie at the intersection of development economics and public policy. Prior to joining ISB, I worked at [Pratham Education Foundation](https://www.pratham.org) on implementing education interventions aimed at improving foundational learning outcomes. 

I hold a Masters in Economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University and a Bachelors from Lady Shri Ram College for Women. I aim to leverage my academic background in Economics to contribute meaningfully to designing effective policies to address pressing development issues.
